This project is a custom implementation of the Amazon homepage, built using HTML, CSS, and some external libraries like Font Awesome. The primary goal was to recreate a user-friendly, responsive e-commerce interface that mimics the look and feel of Amazon’s website. I wanted to demonstrate my front-end development skills and explore how elements like navigation bars, product displays, and search functionalities are handled in real-world websites.
